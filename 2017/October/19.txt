if you are in trouble abroad you should see a consul

World ppeach was the keynote of his speech

I havd no idea in the domain of Maths

What's the  writing trait of the text;

We have implicit trust in him

He killed the elephant for its ivory

I butt on his stomach

The defense of city is  strong

The pupy had climbed onto  my lap an settled in

It's  just such a slap in the face


If you are in trouble abroad you should see a consual

Word peace was the keynote of his speech

I havd no idea in the domain of Maths

What's the writing trait of the text?

We have implict trust in him

A tear rolls down my cheek

The pupy had climbed onto my  lap  and settled in

It's just such a slap in the face

If you are in trouble abroad you should see a consul

World  peace was the  keynote of his speech

I will fetch him for you;

You are such a dick

military training fits men to make long  marches;

The children  always racket about in the courtyard

I retrieve  my jacket from the seat

The  two new buildings dominate the whole town

The children were literally starving

We facilitate them to resist the enemy

The lapse  of time irreversible

if we want light ,we must conquer darkness

The troops will march at dawn

Military training fits men to make a long march

The children  always  racket about in the courtyard

I retrieve my jacket from the seat;

The two new buildings dominate the whole town

The children were literally starving

We facilitate them to resist the enemy

The lapse of time is irreversible

This gate leads into the courtyard

The troops will  march at dawn

He didn't know how to play court to girls

I had a strong desire to help others;

They need to resist the this pressure

The troops advanced

The accident can cripple him for life
i hava a portable typewriter
All haul together one,two,three,haul
Her second marrriage was likewise unhappy

I will take the tube to get here
The bride wore a beautiful white dress
Please pay in cash
what a racket the children are making
The story is a pure myth
a barrel of beer

he is a portirait painter
he was pessimistic about the war
Press this button in case of fire
seize on  opportunity
Did you get wet
The trumpet sounded
The accident can cripple  him for  life
His friends betray him
I have a portable typewriter







he is  a portirait painter
he was pessimistic about the war
The story is a pure myth
size an opportunity
did you get wet
The trumpet sounded

The accident can cripple him for life
his friends betray him
I have a portable typewriter
The Town fell  after a long siege
The water is necessity of life
The story is a pure myth
Don't peek at your new year present
Don't sneak away and hide
 I don't associate with  that crowd
 I don't associate whit that crowd

are you right-handed or left-handed
short-term memory
make a survey
man is  reasoning creature
The ship was approaching the dock

electrion carrier
The play a fragment
what  is the range of your gun
I will reserve my opinion this  time
The clerk could  tackle his buiness with skil
undo the action
Man is a reasoning creature
the ship was approaching the dock
election carrier
the play  was only a fragment
private buiness
I will reverse my opinion this time
The  cleark   tackle his buinsess with skill
he is one of those  who manipulate the market

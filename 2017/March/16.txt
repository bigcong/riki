The two buildings dominate the whole town
a barrel of beer

It's  just such  a slap in the face
I was an alpine before
The city was captured in 1942
I like  the starry winter sky
a volume of book
My room is all Messy
The storm did a great deal of material damage
His cello technique is unique
Please pass me that salt bottle
The children was literally starving
I want a room with a bath
The warm bath relaxed me
Moderm  inventions facillitate housework

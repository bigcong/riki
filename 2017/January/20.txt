what a cracker she is
i hurt my digit
she does't live in this district
You can leave  your umbrella on the entry  
a frist-rate restaurant
he is carrying a linen bag
an indefensible assumption
he is a lgend in business
Endless questions madden me
the country provides a pension  to the old man
A proverb contains the wisdom
i have a queer dream last night
come here,you little rascal













he is carrying a linen bag
Every time ,i get on a ship ,i get seasick
he swears to secrecy about this
